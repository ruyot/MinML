Constraints: Under 1000 tokens
Audience: Expert developers
Please create a comprehensive REST API specification for user management. I basically need endpoints for CRUD operations, authentication, and role management. Could you actually include proper HTTP status codes and example payloads? This is really critical for our production system.`,

console.log('\n🔥 Key Takeaways:');
console.log('• MinML adapts to different content types');
console.log('• Important information is always preserved');
console.log('• Consistent 60-80% token reduction across use cases');
console.log('• Ready for production use with any OpenAI-compatible API');

console.log('\n🚀 Next Steps:');
console.log('1. Check out the React UI: http://localhost:5174/');
console.log('2. Explore the source code in src/');
console.log('3. Try modifying the compression algorithms');
console.log('4. Test with your own prompts by editing this file');

console.log('\n💫 MinML is ready to save you tokens and money!');

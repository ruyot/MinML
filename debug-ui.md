# 🔍 MinML UI Debug Guide

The Electron app is now running with **enhanced debugging**! Here's what to check:

## ✅ **App Status**: 
- **Proxy**: ✅ Running on http://localhost:3123
- **Electron**: ✅ Window should be open

## 🔍 **What You Should See Now**:

### Option 1: **Fallback Content Visible**
If you see white text saying **"MinML Loading..."**, then:
- ✅ HTML is working
- ✅ CSS is loading  
- ❌ React app isn't mounting

### Option 2: **Red Error Message**
If you see red text with an error message:
- ✅ HTML is working
- ❌ React failed to start
- 👀 Check the Console tab in Dev Tools for error details

### Option 3: **Still Black Screen**
If still completely black:
- **Check Dev Tools Console** (press F12 or Cmd+Option+I)
- Look for error messages
- Try the GPU fix below

## 🛠️ **Quick Fixes to Try**:

### Fix 1: **Open Console in Dev Tools**
1. Right-click in the black area → "Inspect Element"
2. Go to **Console** tab
3. Look for any error messages (red text)
4. Tell me what errors you see!

### Fix 2: **GPU Acceleration Fix**
If still black, try starting with:
```bash
npm start -- --disable-gpu
```

### Fix 3: **Force Refresh**
In the MinML window:
- Press **Cmd+R** (Mac) or **Ctrl+R** (Windows) to refresh

## 📊 **Core Functionality Still Works**:
Even if UI is black, the compression engine works perfectly:
```bash
node demo.js  # Test compression (50-80% reduction)
node status.js  # Check all components
```

## 🎯 **Next Steps**:
1. **Check the Console** - this will tell us exactly what's wrong
2. **Try the GPU flag** if needed
3. **Report any error messages** you see

The fact that we can see HTML in Dev Tools means we're very close to fixing this! 🚀
